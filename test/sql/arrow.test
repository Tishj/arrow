# description: round trip arrow serialization
# group: [arrow]

# NOTE: for now there's not much we can test here, since we cannot really pass pointers from the
#       serialized blobs to the scan_arrow_ipc function in SQL. Therefore tests of these features
#       currently live in the NodeJS client tests.

require arrow

statement ok
SELECT * FROM to_arrow_ipc((SELECT 'Its working!'));
